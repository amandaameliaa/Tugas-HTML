        Lyrics: 
<br>Memories follow me left and right 
<br>I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
<br>you take up every corner of my mind 
<br>whatcha gon do now 
<br><br>
<br>ever since the da day y-you went away
<br>no I don't know how 
<br>how to erase your body from out my brain 
<br>whatcha gon do now
<br>maybe I should just focus on me instead
<br>But all I think about 
<br>are the nights we were tangled up in your bed
<br><br>
<br>oh no (oh no)
<br>oh no (oh no)
<br>youre going round in circles got you stuck up in my head (yeah)
<br><br>
<br>Memories follow me left and right 
<br>I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
<br>you take up every corner of my mind 
<br>your love stays with me day and night 
<br>I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
<br>you take up every corner of my mind 
<br>whatcha gon do now
<br><br>
<br>ever since the da da day y-you went away 
<br>someone tell me how 
<br>how much more do I gotta drink for the pain 
<br>whatcha gon do now
<br>you did things to me that I just can't forget 
<br>now all I think about 
<br>are the nights we were tangled up in your bed 
<br>oh no (oh no)
<br>oh no (oh no)
<br>you're going round in circles got ya stuck up in my head 
<br><br>
<br>Memories follow me left and right 
<br>I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
<br>you take up every corner of my mind 
<br>your love stays with me day and night 
<br>I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
<br>you take up every corner of my mind 
<br>whatcha gon do now
<br><br>
<br>did ya know youre the one that got away
<br>and even now baby i'm still not ok 
<br>did ya know that my dreams they're are the same 
<br>everytime I close my eyes 
<br><br>
<br>Memories follow me left and right 
<br>I can feel you over here I can feel you over here 
<br>you take up every corner of my mind 
<br>whatcha gon do now
<br>your love stays with me day and night 
<br>I can feel you over here i can feel you over here 
<br>you take up every corner of my mind 
<br>whatcha gon do now
<br><br>
<br>I can feel you over here I can feel you over here
<br>you take up every corner of my mind 
<br>whatcha gon do now
